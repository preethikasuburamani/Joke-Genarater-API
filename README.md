**Joke Generator (Fetch API & Logic)**
A fun, interactive web application that delivers a quick laugh at the click of a button. This project demonstrates the use of Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises/Async-Await) to fetch data from a third-party API, as well as fallback logic using local arrays.

**How to Run**
1)Clone the repository to your local machine.

2)Open jokeGenarater.html in your browser.

3)Click the "Generate Joke" button to start laughing!

✨**Key Features**
Dual-Mode Logic: Built with two functions—one that fetches jokes in real-time from the official-joke-api and a secondary function that pulls from a curated local list.

Instant Interaction: Quick-response button to generate new content without page reloads.

Clean UI: A centered, distraction-free interface with a soft color palette for a friendly user experience.

Quality Assured: Includes a comprehensive set of Manual Test Cases (CSV/Excel) covering functionality, integration, and edge cases (like network failure).

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
HTML5: Semantic structure for the generator interface.

CSS3: Flexbox-driven layout with custom hover states and responsive positioning.

JavaScript (ES6+): * fetch() API for data retrieval.

async/await for handling asynchronous operations.

Event listeners for user interaction.
